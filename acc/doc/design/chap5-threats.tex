\subsection{Identified threats and countermeasures}


	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Threat 1:} Manipulation
            
            \textbf{Description:} An attacker could attempt to alter the messages transmitted between Node 1 and Node 2. This could result in false sensor data or control commands being introduced, leading to dangerous situations (e.g., incorrect distance = incorrect speed control).
            
            \textbf{Solution:} Data integrity is ensured by an HMAC (hash-based message authentication code).
%			Requirement see \ref{req.1.1} \\
        
        \paragraph{} 
		\item \textbf{Threat 2:} Denial of Service (DoS)
            
            \textbf{Description:} An attacker or jammer could block the Bluetooth connection (e.g., through jamming or flooding). This would render sensor data unavailable and cause the ACC to lose its basis.
            
            \textbf{Solution:} Implementation of a timeout mechanism for Bluetooth messages. If the connection fails for longer than a defined period of time, the system automatically switches to manual operation.
%			Requirement see \ref{req.1.1} \\
        
        \paragraph{} 
		\item \textbf{Threat 3:} Replay-Attack
            
            \textbf{Description:} An attacker could resend previously intercepted messages to Node 2 (replay). This could allow outdated but formally valid distance data to be used, leading to dangerous rule decisions.
            
            \textbf{Solution:} Use of a sequence counter or sequential message number in each packet.
%			Requirement see \ref{req.1.1} \\
