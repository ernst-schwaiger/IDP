## What is the IEC 61508? Explain some fundamentals

### The Functional Safety Lifecycle

In order to manage functional safety, IEC_61508 introduces a safety lifecycle, which includes the following
phases:

- Concept Phase: Defining the scope and objectives of the safety-related system.
- Overall Scope Definition: Identifying the overall boundaries of the system under consideration.
- Hazard and Risk Assessment: Identifying potential hazards and assessing the associated risks.
- Allocation of Safety Functions to Protection Layers: Determining which safety functions are necessary and how they will be implemented across different layers of protection, including the SIS.
- Safety Requirements Specification: Defining the detailed requirements for each safety function, including its required SIL.
- Design and Implementation (E/E/PE System Hardware): Designing and selecting the hardware components of the SIS.
- Design and Implementation (Application Software): Developing the software for programmable electronic logic solvers.
- Validation: Confirming that the designed and implemented SIS meets the specified safety requirements.
- Installation, Commissioning, and Final Acceptance: Installing, testing, and formally accepting the SIS.
- Operation and Maintenance: Establishing procedures for the safe operation and maintenance of the SIS, including proof testing and fault management.
- Modification: Managing any changes to the SIS throughout its operational life.
- Decommissioning: Safely removing the SIS from service at the end of its lifecycle.
