### Definition

The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) defines functional safety as “the safety which depends on the *correct functioning* of the *E/E/PE safety-related systems* in response to their *inputs*, including the *response to* operator *errors*, hardware failures and systematic *failures*.”

- E/E/PE safety-related systems: electrical, electronic, or programmable electronic safety-related systems
- Correct Functioning: The system must operate as intended under all relevant conditions.
- Inputs: These can be process variables (e.g., temperature, pressure, level), operator commands, or internal signals.
- Response to Errors and Failures: The safety system must be designed to either prevent dangerous failures or, if they occur, to detect them and initiate a safe shutdown or other protective action.

Functional safety is, [...], “Protecting a user from technology”. It also protects technology from users. More technically however, the definition of Functional Safety is, “Systems that lead to the freedom from unacceptable risk of injury or damage to the health of people by the proper implementation of one or more automatic protection functions (often called safety functions). A safety system consists of one or more safety functions.”

"is part of the overall safety that depends on a system or equipment operating correctly in response to its inputs."
-- IEC 61508


### Purpose

The purpose of functional safety is to protect the user, directly, or indirectly (e.g. via environmental
damage or money loss) from harm.

In manufacturing facilities for instance, functional safety is critical to safe operation. Functional safety systems can give operators far better operational metrics and control of the equipment under use. From a business standpoint – functional safety allows manufacturers to operate closer to their margins with confidence in a well-defined functional safety environment. This benefits them in terms of increased efficiencies, fewer downtimes, and the resulting cost savings.

The aim of Functional safety is to bring risk down to a tolerable level and to reduce its negative impact; however, there is no such thing as zero risk. Functional safety measures risk by how likely it is that a given event will occur and how severe it would be; in other words: how much harm it could cause.

Many systems today are designed to automatically prevent dangerous failures or to control them when they arise.
Such failures can arise for example from:
- random or systematic failures of hardware or software
- human error
- environmental circumstances such as for example temperature, weather, electro-magnetic interference or mechanical phenomena
- loss of electricity supply or other disturbances
- incorrect specifications of the system; both hardware or software;
- omissions in the specifications of safety requirements (e.g. failure to put in place all relevant safety
functions in line with different modes of operation).

### Applications

- Automotive: Airbags, ABS, Sunroof control, autonomous driving, steer-by wire, break-by-wire
- Public Transport: Railway signaling, Train door control, automated flight control
- Medical: infusion pumps, heart-rate monitors, cardiac pacemaker
- Manufacturing: Systems controling valves, preventing robots from moving when humans are near
- Energy: Conrol Systems for Atomic Power Plants, Wind turbine protection systems
